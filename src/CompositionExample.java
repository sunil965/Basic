/*Composition

Composition is a restricted form of Aggregation in which two entities are highly dependent on each other.

It represents part-of relationship.
In composition, both the entities are dependent on each other.
When there is a composition between two entities, the composed object cannot exist without the other entity.

In above example a library can have no. of books on same or different subjects. So, If Library gets destroyed then All books within that
 particular library will be destroyed. i.e. book can not exist without library. Thatâ€™s why it is composition.
